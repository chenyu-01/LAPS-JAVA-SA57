## Run Locally

# Running the Java Application

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the Java application on your system. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth setup and execution.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java (JDK)
- MySQL Server

## Step 1: Modify `application.properties`

First, you need to configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.
2. Locate the following properties:
spring.datasource.username=
spring.datasource.password=
3. Replace the above lines with your MySQL username and password. For example:
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=myPassword
4. Ensure the `spring.datasource.url` property matches your local MySQL setup:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/SA
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/SA
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Or, if you are using Windows:
mvnw spring-boot:run

The application should now start and be accessible. Ensure that the database server is running and accessible for the application to connect to.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the following:

- Ensure that MySQL server is running.
- Verify that the database username and password in `application.properties` are correct.
- Confirm that the `spring.datasource.url` in `application.properties` correctly points to your MySQL database.
