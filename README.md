## Todo List
### 1. Setup Basic Configuration
- [x] Configure your `application.properties` or `application.yml` for database connection settings and any other required configurations.
- [x] Set up basic authentication and security settings, if not already done.

### 2. Implement Repository Layer
- [ ] Ensure that `LeaveApplicationRepository`, `LeaveTypeRepository`, `UserRepository`, and other necessary repositories are properly set up with JPA to interact with the database.

### 3. Create Service Layer
- [ ] Implement service classes (`LeaveApplicationService`, `LeaveTypeService`, `UserService`, etc.) to contain business logic.
- [ ] For each service, implement methods such as `findAll`, `findById`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, etc., as applicable.

### 4. Develop Controllers
- [ ] Flesh out `LeaveApplicationController`, `LeaveTypeController`, `UserController`, etc., to handle HTTP requests.
    - [ ] Implement CRUD operations for each entity.
    - [ ] Add validation for request data.
    - [ ] Implement exception handling for better error responses.

### 5. User Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Implement user authentication in `AuthController`.
- [ ] Set up roles and permissions for Admin, Manager, and Employee in the security configuration.

### 6. Leave Application Logic
- [ ] Implement leave application submission logic including validations (dates, types, etc.).
- [ ] Handle leave application status transitions (Applied, Updated, Deleted, Cancelled, Approved, Rejected).

### 7. Admin-specific Functionalities
- [ ] Allow Admin to manage users, roles, and leave types.
- [ ] Implement functionality to manage public holidays and annual leave entitlements.

### 8. Manager-specific Functionalities
- [ ] Enable Managers to approve/reject leave applications.
- [ ] Implement functionalities for Managers to view and manage subordinate leave histories.

### 9. Employee-specific Functionalities
- [ ] Allow Employees to apply for, update, cancel, and view their leave history.

### 10. Reporting and Analytics
- [ ] (Optional) Implement reporting features for Managers (leave reports, compensation claims, etc.).

### 11. REST API Endpoints
- [ ] Ensure all functionalities are exposed as RESTful APIs.
- [ ] Document API endpoints for frontend integration.

### 12. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for your services and controllers.
- [ ] Validate application functionality thoroughly.

### 13. Additional Features (If Applicable)
- [ ] Implement email notifications for leave applications and approvals.
- [ ] Add pagination for listing leave records.

### 14. Final Steps
- [ ] Perform thorough testing of the entire application.
- [ ] Ensure proper documentation of the codebase.
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (if applicable).

Remember to commit changes regularly and maintain good version control practices. Also, consider implementing logging for easier debugging and maintenance.
